# Cohort_Analysis-Customer_Segmentation

Jupyter notebook (python) is a solution to an assignment I got from an Ed-tech startup. 
The notebook contains:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (obviously)
2. Cohort Analysis - It helps in comparing performance/engagement of users who joined the platform at different time periods
3. Clustering and Segmentation - K-means clustering is performed to find homogenous groups of users from the user base. Then those clusters are defined and hence user segments are formed

More details on the problem statement can be found in the excel file
